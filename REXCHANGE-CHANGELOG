-- 0.3.4:
* Updated the README so it jives with the current version
* Removed Folder::join since it's only used by Folder#to_s, and just used a simpler
	solution in Folder#to_s instead

-- 0.3.3:
* Folder objects now default to using the Message class for enumeration 
  if no class is associated with the content_type of the Folder.
  
-- 0.3.2:
* Quick hack to make Message#move_to work

-- 0.3.1:
* Disabled a warning about overwriting GenericItem::CONTENT_CLASS
* Added a "rescue" for Time::parse failures that reverts to the original element text

-- 0.3.0:
* Added support for Appointments
* Options hash for Session creation is gone. The new form is: "RExchange::Session.new(url, username, password)"
* Removed GenericItem#[], GenericItem#method_missing (attributes are explicit now)
* Removed Folder#get_messages, #get_contacts and #messages_in. Folders are now Enumerables using Enumerable#entries, #each, etc
  to retrieve entries according to the folder's content-class. So a 'mailfolder' will retrieve Message instances,
  a 'calendarfolder' will retrieve Appointment instances, and so on.

-- 0.2.0:
* Fixed a bug in Message#move_to when passing folders
* Added support for Contact browsing
* Added GenericItem to abstract Contacts and Messages
* Renamed Folder#messages to Folder#get_messages to avoid naming collisions
* Modified attributes in GenericItem that end with "date" to be Time::parse'd
* Added "r_exchange.rb" for Rails auto-require compatibility
* Now calling String#normalize on attribute names instead of just String#tr('-', '_')

-- 0.1.4:
* Moved Folder::normalize_folder_name to String#normalize, and added support for MixedCase sources.
* Fixed a bug where the normalized folder name was being used for the Folder#to_s result.
* Moved the meat of Folder#messages to Message::find
* Added Message#to_s
* Modified Folder#get_folders to return a hash instead of an array, providing both the original, and normalized names.

-- 0.1.3: Bugfixes
* Fixed several nasty bugs.

-- 0.1.2: Minor documentation/cleanup
* Removed a double-dash in the README that was apparently causing some viewing errors
* Changed Session initialize to a ternary condition
* Added RExchange::Message#has_attachments?
* Added documentation for most methods in RExchange::Message and RExchange::Folder
